Football Data Analysis, Prediction, and Modeling

Description

This Python project offers a comprehensive solution for football data analysis, outcome prediction, and modeling. It seamlessly handles historical football match data sourced from various channels, encompassing odds, statistics, and match results. The project architecture is modular, with distinct modules catering to different aspects of analyzing and forecasting football match outcomes.

Key Features

Data Analysis:

Parses and processes historical football match data from multiple datasets, ensuring uniformity and compatibility for further analysis.

Calculates and visualizes key statistics such as home wins, away wins, draws, goal differentials, past form, and points differentials.

Assesses team performance based on past match results, computing win percentages, losses, and draws for different sequences of past matches.

Computes the average win percentage for each team across multiple seasons, presenting it in a pie chart format.

Analyzes points differentials between teams in each match week and correlates them with match outcomes.

Utilizes diverse visualization techniques, including bar charts and pie charts, to present analysis results effectively.


Outcome Prediction:

Employs machine learning techniques to forecast football match outcomes.

Conducts data preprocessing tasks such as column reduction, categorical variable handling, and feature preparation for model training.

Extracts pertinent features from the dataset and preprocesses them for training, including categorical variable conversion into dummy variables.

Trains machine learning classifiers using prepared features and target labels, employing techniques like Grid Search Cross-Validation for hyperparameter tuning.

Generates predictions on test data and evaluates their performance using metrics such as F1 score and accuracy.


Modeling:

Involves dataset creation and machine learning model development for predicting soccer match outcomes based on historical data.

Scrapes and cleans data from multiple CSV files containing soccer match statistics from various seasons.

Generates a final dataset post preprocessing, containing all necessary features for training the machine learning model.

Evaluates the performance of the trained model using a separate testing dataset comprising match data from a specific season.


How to Use

Data Analysis:

Organize football match data in separate datasets with required columns such as date, home team, away team, goals scored, and match result.

Modify the parse_date functions if date formats in datasets differ, ensuring uniformity in date formatting across all datasets.

Concatenate playing statistics from different datasets into a single dataframe using pd.concat.

Execute analysis functions like get_result_stats, get_past_form, get_cuml_points, and points_diff to derive insights.

Utilize provided visualization functions for creating visual representations of analysis results.


Outcome Prediction:

Install Python along with necessary dependencies (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost).

Ensure presence of final_dataset.csv file in the same directory as the script, containing historical football match data with relevant features and outcomes.

Execute prediction_engine.py script using a Python interpreter to initiate prediction process and view results on console.


Modeling:

Run "Scraping and cleaning file" to scrape and clean soccer match data from provided CSV files, ensuring correct file paths.

Run "Soccer_Prediction file" to preprocess data, build machine learning model, and generate final dataset.

Use generated final_dataset.csv for training machine learning model to predict soccer match outcomes.
Evaluate performance of trained model using testing dataset test.csv.
